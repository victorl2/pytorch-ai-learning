# Pytorch AI Learning
This repository is my personal guide used to learn AI with [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), some other python libraries are also mixed in as a way consolidate different concepts. This learning journey assumes programming experience, not so much with advanced python, but programming concepts in general _( object oriented programming, data structures and other fundamentals )_.

_This material was inspired by [**3Blue1Brown**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) amazing explanations + visualization and also [**Sentdex**](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) for some of the best hands on content about AI with python._
